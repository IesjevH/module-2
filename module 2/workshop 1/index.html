    <p>Best known for being involved with three public companies tackling three of the world’s biggest problems (Tesla, Space X, Solar City), Elon Musk first learned to program when he was only twelve. His parents bought him a computer, and a few days later he built a video game you can still play today called Blastar. He is known for inspiring entrepreneurs, saying things like
